# Programming from the Beginning

I've noticed throughout my computer science tutoring career that programming usually poorly taught.  The fundamentals are skipped through almost entirely - it's like trying to learn to play hockey without learning how to ice skate first.  They skip through explaining what something does and just have you copy and paste something you don't understand yet, thinking "oh, you'll get it.".  The students are led to believe that code is magic.

It's not.

Programming langauges are very exact, and there is no magic.  Every piece works the way it does for a reason.

I've created this tutorial to help people learn how programming actually works, starting from the beginning (what does this piece mean) rather than the end (paste this in and see if you can read it).

####Note on Macs:
You'll use Command key instead of the Control key.  Everywhere I say "CTRL", just use Command instead.
