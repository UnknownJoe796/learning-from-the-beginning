##Setting up Light Table

Download and run [Light Table](http://lighttable.com/).  This will vary depending on what OS (as in Windows, Mac, or Linux) you are using, but it will be as simple as downloading the file, unzipping it, and opening LightTable.

Looks like a nice, simple text editor, eh?  It has a lot of hidden power.  You can access all of the things it can do by pressing CTRL + SPACE.  It will open a drawer on the right side of the window where you can search all of the things the editor can do and use them.

Let's get things set up for Javascript.

- Make a new file. (CTRL + N)
- Set the *syntax* (language) of the file by pressing CTRL + SPACE and typing "syntax".  Select the action called "Editor: Set current editor syntax" and pick Javascript.
- Press CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER to run your empty file.  It will pop up with a message saying "No client available."
- Click "Connect a client".
- Click "Browser".  It should open up a blank white page.  For now, you can just switch back to our file by clicking it's tab on the top.

To run your work, you can use:

- CTRL + ENTER which runs only the line your cursor is on or whatever you have selected
- or CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER, which runs the entire file.

If it doesn't work, try connecting it to "Light Table UI" instead.

You're now ready to begin!

Sidenote: You are able to use Light Table for a lot of different languages in a similar way to how we're using it for Javascript.  You'll have to go to them for more information.
