#A Comment About Comments

Comments are text inside code files that aren't run by the computer.

Writing comments how you keep notes on what your code means.  Without writing notes, it's easy to forget what a certain piece of code does.

Other people will probably read your code and comments too, so they should be written in plain, easy-to-read English.

They look like this:

    //This is a comment.

    Real code is here.  //However, this part is a comment.

    Here is some more code.

    //More comments!!

    /*This is a special type of comment
    that can be really long and
    go across many lines.*/

    More code!!

Anything that comes after // on a line is just a comment and the computer just ignores it.

Same thing goes for anything inbetween /\* and \*/.
